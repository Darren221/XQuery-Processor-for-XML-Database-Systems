# XQuery-Processor-for-XML-Database-Systems

Project Description:

This project aims to develop an efficient XQuery processor and optimizer that can parse, evaluate, and optimize XQueries for XML files. The processor will work through a series of interconnected steps to ensure seamless query execution and optimization.

Step 1: Develop a naive query execution engine to parse and evaluate simplified XPath expressions, using a recursive evaluation routine to process the query and generate a list of output nodes. The ANTLR 4 parser generator will be employed to create the XQuery parser based on the provided grammar.

Step 2: Extend the processor to handle more complex XQuery expressions, enhancing the evaluation engine to support element creation, concatenation, and other XQuery constructs for more sophisticated query processing.

Step 3: Implement an efficient join operator to optimize query execution, enabling the processor to detect if the FOR and WHERE clause computation can be performed using the join operator. This leads to more efficient query processing while assuming input XQueries to be in the simplified syntax provided in the notes.

Throughout the project, the processor will utilize the standard DOM interface to access XML files, employing either Java's built-in XML DOM parser or the Apache Xerces-J project to ensure compatibility with widely-used technologies.
